    <div class="jobPageHeading">ABOUT US</div>

    <div class="jobTextContainer">
      <p>Canopy Energy is a full service General Contractor specializing in energy efficient home improvements. We are one of the 10 largest installers of residential Solar in California. Because of our history in home improvement and status as a general contractor, we have a distinct competitive advantage over the competition. Simply put, we install solar on homes that other installers can&#39;t or won&#39;t and we have a wide range of other products so there are multiple upsell and cross-sell opportunities. Currently, we have 5 sales offices and over 100 sales reps in California with plans to expand to 7 offices and 150 sales reps in the next 6 months.</p>
